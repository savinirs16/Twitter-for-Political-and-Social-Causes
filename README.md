# Twitter-for-Political-and-Social-Causes
People don't have complete idea on how to take action for a political cause.
It is difficult to mobilize people to take action for a political cause (vote PLZ had less than half of the turnout it expected.)
Politicians and political causes are generally backed up by companies.The platform will allow people to indicate which issues they find most important in order to receive information about what purchases to make and actions to take. 
Our platform will use social media data as well as public information from congress to make suggestions to citizens. 
We can crowdsource citizens to take micro-actions whether to support or oppose a political candidate or cause.
By making purchases on items supplied by several companies, citizens can take a direct  action to support or oppose a political candidate.
